# Map Generator Two-Dimensional Demo

I wrote this program as an exercise to learn the Rust programming language. It was imagined as an RTS game called "Hivebotica." It uses the Bevy game engine.

I finished the map generator part, but then I got busy with my classes at CCAC. 

Now I have switched to a new project after I decided Hivebotica is too ambitious for one developer.

I plan to put the demo up as a web page when I get the time. Currently, it is only available as source code or as a Windows executable.
