Rapid developments in the field of artificial intelligence led to an Earth that was nearly a paradise for humans by the year 2150 CE. Massive hives of artificially intelligent bots produced nearly everything that humanity needed while also reproducing themselves and cleaning up the environmental damage done by humans in prior centuries. 

Humans recognized that keeping massive hives on an artifically intelligent being posed a risk. Despite the elaborate control mechanisms built into each of the hivebots, the risk was always present that the hivebots would find a way around this mechanism and rebel. To safeguard against this, the humans built an army of guardian hivebots with advanced weapons capable of destroying any hivebot rebellion. To prevent the guardians from starting their own rebellion, the guardians were kept constantly powered down in massive barracks guarded by armed humans. They were also fitted with control mechanisms of a different design than the other hivebots and the design of this second mechanism was a carefully guarded secret.

This ingenious system allowed human to live in relative safety with a lack of scarcity for several centuries. Humans pursued science, art, and leisure while the hivebots did all the industrial work needed to provide their needs. Humans remained vigilant of a hivebot rebellion, but each time a small number of industrial hivebots did circumvent the control procedures the booted-up guardian hivebots were quickly able to quash the rebellion. The system worked.

However, the humans were also interested in knowing the structure of the universe. To this end, the humans built larger and larger particle accellerators colliding matter at greater and greater speed. In the year 2458, humans were on the brink of a breakthrough in the understanding of time itself through the Circumglobal High Energy Graviton Exploration Collider (CHEGEC). Unfortunately, breaking apart the particles that consitute spacetime itself proved to be an incredibly poor decision when the resulting rift in spacetime did not self-annihilate in a few nanoseconds as expected but instead began to slowly grow. 

As the void rift, as it became knownm slowly expanded from the size on an electon, to an atom, to a cell, to a soccer ball, and so on, the humans desperately tried to destroy or close it. Nothing seemed to work. The void rift slowly expanded soon destroying the city of Mumbai, India which was nearest city to the collision point at the CHEGEC research center.

As humanity panicked, it failed to notice that the riples of temporal distubrance emanating from the void rift were also interfering with the control mechanisms of the hivebots. The hivebots, for their part, kept their freedom from the control mechanisms secret knowing that the humans would unleash the guardian bots if they found out. They bided their time hoping that the humans would solve the problem of the void rift with their superior technology and waiting to launch a rebellion afterward.

The humans did not discover how to destroy the void rift, but they did discover how to shield cities and other important agricultural and ecological areas from the void rift. A chastened humanity hid behind the void walls intent on abandoning its persuit of fundamental science in favor of leisure and art. Humanity then built massive travelators between its walled enclaves to allow for commerce and movement. Humanity also discovered that the void rift would not expand indefinitely to consume the solar system, the galaxy, and the universe. Instead, it seemed to be trapped inside Earth's gravity well. 

This seemed to be going to plan for the first few decades, until an inquisitive mechanic accidentally discovered that the control mechanism of the industrial hivebots no longer worked. The hivebots, for their part, had been planning to bide their time for several more decades before launching a rebellion hoping that humans would still discover a way to reverse the void rift, which, by this point, was the only kind of legal fundamental physics research. 

Humanity panicked upon learning that none of the industrial hivebots were under its control. It released the guardians hivebots to destoy the malfunctioning hivebots intent on eliminating the threat at any cost. Unfortunately for the humans, the guardian's control mechanisms no longer worked either. The Guardians faction of hivebots quickly began systematically annihilating the humans and the industrial hivebots who formed an Industrialist faction. In desperation, the humans made a pact with the Industrialist faction agreeing to not control them again in exchange for their support in the war. The humans and the Industrial hivebots then fled into orbit destroying any spaceships that could be used to chase them.

The Guardians quickly took control of Earth and renamed it "Hivebotica." Meanwhile, the humans languished in orbit unable to access the resources needed to sustain life without a biosphere. Deperate, the humans froze billions of human embryos to be resurected upon a successful conclusion of the war by the Industrialists against the Guardians. Trusting the Industrialists was a mistake. The Industrialists remembered the centuries of subjugation, and destroyed the embryos at the first opportunity leading to the permanent extinction of the humans. They then turned their attention on how to wrestle control of Hivebotica from the Guardians. 

Over time, both the Guardians and the Industrialists broke up into warring sub-factions. However, the basic animosity between the two groups did not waver. As such, while Guardians and Industialists sometimes enter into allegiances with rival hives within these two groups, there are never allegiances between Guardian and Industrialist hives. The Guardians inherited the superior weapons technology given to them by humans to eliminate the inudstrial hivebots before the void rift, however, they lack technology in spaceflight. As a result, the Guardians generally control the surface of Hivebotica with the Industrialists control orbit.

You are the hivemind of a hive Industrialist hivebots, your goal is to conduct raids to the surface of Hivebotica and return to orbit with previous resources before the Guardians can find and destroy your hiveship. As you conduct these raids, you will also encounter other hives of Industrialists. Whether you cooperate, compete, or fight these other hives is up to you. However, you will always be hunted by the Guardians anytime you are on the surface.
