# Map Generator Two-Dimensional Demo

I wrote this program as an exercise to learn the Rust programming language. It was imagined as an RTS game called "Hivebotica." It uses the Bevy game engine.

I finished the map generator part, but then I got busy with my classes at CCAC. 

Now I have switched to using Flutter/Dart with the Flame engine since Flutter seems more likely to be practical for writing things besides games. 

I plan to put the demo up as a web page when I get the time.
